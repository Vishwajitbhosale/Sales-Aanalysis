# Sales-Aanalysis

Description:

You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non - holiday weeks.
